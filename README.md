# stationarity_chi_square for categorical (qualitative) variables
calculates percentage of stationary binary partitions of a temporal sequence of categorical variables using the chi-square test of independence
*The script [Stationarity_ofPartitions_Loop.R] calculates percentage of stationary of all predefined (i.e. possible) binary partitions of a temporal sequence to determine the percentage of how many of them are stationary

It has been used in
